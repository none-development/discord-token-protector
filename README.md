<h2 align="center">About DTP</h2>

DTP (Discord Token Protector) is a Tool to Protect the DB from Discord. You need to close Discord for all Features. The program is intended if you run programs from developers, but do not know if they can be trusted, you can close Discord and encrypt the DB where your tokens and chats are. 

**Why don't you make a plugin for BetterDiscord?**
Because I don't want to do this in JS and have to design a complete new Discord for the encryption.
